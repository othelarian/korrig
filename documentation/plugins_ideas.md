# Plugins ideas

This is a list of plugins I already have in mind for Korrig.

- whiteboard (I really want this one)
- diceroller (include the One?)
- character sheets, with a system similar to Fari's
- Rune-like map (with a map editor of course)
- Zombicide like map (same as the Rune-like one)
- oracles with range
- story manager
- chapter writer, conversation mode
