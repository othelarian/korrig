# The Korrig project

## What's Korrig?

Korrig is a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) webapp, similar in is concept to [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) and [FeatherWiki](https://feather.wiki/).

Why another quine wiki? Because I can! Also because TiddlyWiki is now quite heavy, with a lot of integrated mechanics already integrated, and it clutter the developpement of plugins to firstly understand all its internal structure. FeatherWiki on the other hand would be a good choice but lack a true plugin system.

The purpose of Korrig is then to propose a really lightweight webapp (hopefully less than 100kb) with 3 main features:

- an article storage (like any wiki)
- a tag system
- a plugin system
