# The Korrig project

## What's Korrig?

Korrig is a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) webapp, similar in is concept to [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) and [FeatherWiki](https://feather.wiki/).

Why another quine wiki? Because I can! Also because TiddlyWiki is now quite heavy, with a lot of stuff already integrated in it, making plugin development hard when touching at too much of it. FeatherWiki on the other hand would be a good choice but lack a true plugin system, meaning you have to fork it for any large modification.

The purpose of Korrig is to propose a really lightweight webapp (hopefully less than 100kB) with 3 main features:

- an article storage (like any wiki)
- a tag system
- a plugin system
